# Code of Conduct  

As participants in the DSCI 310 project, we are committed to creating a collaborative, respectful, and inclusive environment. This Code of Conduct outlines the standards of behavior expected from all group members to ensure a positive working experience for everyone. It applies to all interactions related to the project, including class meetings, team discussions, email communication, and online platforms such as GitHub and Slack.  

## Our Commitment  

We pledge to:  

- Foster a welcoming environment where all members feel valued and respected  
- Collaborate openly and communicate ideas without fear of judgment  
- Support each other's learning and growth throughout the project  

Discrimination or harassment based on personal characteristics — including gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, race, ethnicity, nationality, age, socioeconomic status, or education level — will not be tolerated.  

## Expected Behavior  

To maintain a positive team environment, we expect all participants to:  

- Communicate respectfully and listen actively to others' ideas  
- Offer constructive feedback and accept suggestions with an open mind  
- Be reliable by meeting deadlines and contributing equally to group tasks  
- Ask for help when needed and support others who seek assistance  
- Recognize and appreciate the contributions of all team members  

## Unacceptable Behavior  

The following behaviors are not acceptable in our group:  

- Disrespectful or exclusionary language  
- Harassment, intimidation, or threats  
- Persistent interruption or dismissal of others' ideas  
- Refusal to collaborate or fulfill assigned responsibilities  
- Sharing private information or communications without consent  

## Conflict Resolution  

If conflicts arise, we will first try to address them through open and respectful discussion within the group. If the issue cannot be resolved, we will escalate the matter to the **DSCI 310 Instructor(s)** or teaching assistants for mediation.  

## Reporting Violations  

If any participant witnesses or experiences behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, they should report it to the **DSCI 310 Instructor(s)**. All reports will be handled with confidentiality and care.  

The current instructor **Daniel Chen** can be contacted via **Piazza messaging**.  

By participating in this project, all members agree to abide by this Code of Conduct.
